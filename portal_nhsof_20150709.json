The four indicators cover groin hernia, hip replacements, knee replacements and varicose veins.\n\n\n\nPlease note that these indicators have been retired as of May 2015. This is because the four indicators reporting the total health gain on seperate procedures have been combined into one indicator (Total health gain as assessed by patients for physical health-related procedures) in the 2015/16 NHS Outcomes Framework. This newly combined indicator is currently a placeholder and has yet to be developed.",
